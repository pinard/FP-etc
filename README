README for the FP Etc. project
==============================

.. contents::

This package contains a random collection of files which are useful to
me (so the "FP" initials), and probably might be useful to others as
well, but do not otherwise belong to any package (so the "etc.").

Allout-Vim
==========

This package offers Allout mode, as found within Emacs, within a
Python-enabled Vim.  This is my first packaging of a Vim script.
See the `Allout-Vim documentation file`__.

Babyl
=====

This `Python script`__ is able to read message files either in Babyl
format (used by Emacs RMAIL), Unix mailbox format, Usenet articles, and
a few others.  It may produce a mere summary of the given message file,
convert it to either Babyl or mbox, or produce an enscript listing of
it.

__ /scripts/babyl

By converting a message file to the format it already has, the tool may
also be used for repairing slightly damaged files.

Gantt
=====

This `Python script`__ is an activity scheduler, and Gantt diagram
printer.  It can read many projects simultaneously and automatically
distribute unassigned project tasks to workers.

__ /scripts/gantt

Tasks may depend on dates, or on one another.  Workers may be known to
be only partially available, or only some specific weekdays.  Printouts
*do not* rely on fancy bitmapped graphics, they rather can be seen
on a dumb terminal or sent in simple emails.  There is a short `User
manual`__, written in French.

Pynits
======

This package offers a few commands, editing Python sources within a
Python-enabled Vim, for tidying up long (or even short!) lines.
See the `README file for Pynits`__.

RKE
===

The Runge-Kutta-England tool is a differential equation solver written
in C, which I used a few times in continuous simulation contexts.  This
is a fourth order Runge-Kutta solver combined with an heuristic for
implementing an adaptative step size.  There is an extensive usage
documentation for it: see the `README file for RKE`__.
