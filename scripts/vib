This utility can be used to update a file entry while keeping the
timestamp intact. This is very useful for blog entries that are time
critical and you do not wish the time to get updated in any way.

Since this utility works like a wrapper for you favourite editor,
replace the EDITOR line below to reflect the command to your favourite
editor, be it nano, pico or bbedit, etc. Tested on un*x only.
