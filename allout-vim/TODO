* TODO items for Allout support in Vim

.. Documentation issues
. : Simplify documentation to be line-oriented instead of node-oriented.
. : Document `skip=' settings for all commands.
.. Improving commands

. : Make sure error reporting is consistent and proper.
. : Revise all `skip=' settings, to see if these are the most useful.
