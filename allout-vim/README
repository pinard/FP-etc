.. README file for Allout-Vim

   The Allout file format is (yet another) legible representation of the
   synoptic structure of a textual document.  Emacs support for Allout
   files is already standard, as an application of fold editing.  This
   tool eases the handling of Allout files from within a Python-enabled
   Vim.

   This `README' file is already a very simple Allout format file, which
   you may use for experimenting.  The real documentation is kept in
   file "vim/doc.txt", which you may browse or print, but this one is
   _not_ an Allout file however, as it is meant for the Vim help system.
   Once the installation is completed as per the steps described below,
   and from within Vim, you may quickly get back to the documentation
   through the command:

           :help allout

. : System-wide installation

    If you have super-user privileges, this tool may be installed
    system-wide, for all users.  From the top-level directory of the
    unpacked `Allout' distribution, and within VIM, do:

            :!cp vim/syntax.vim $RUNTIME/syntax/allout.vim
            :!cp vim/ftplugin.vim $RUNTIME/ftplugin/allout.vim
            :!cp vim/doc.txt $RUNTIME/doc/allout.txt
            :helptags $RUNTIME/doc
            :!python setup.py install

    To check if the last step succeeded, as any ordinary user, call Python
    interactively and try:

            import Allout.vim

    If you get any error, you should likley investigate the overall
    Python setup at your site and repair what needs to be.

. : Personal installation

    If you do not have super-user privileges, this tool may be installed
    for yourself only.  Merely type `make install' from the unpacked
    `allout-vim' distribution.  The `~/.vimrc' file should be modified,
    or created if necessary, so it holds the following lines:

            if has('python')
              python <<EOF
            import os, sys, vim
            sys.path.append(os.path.expanduser('~/.vim/python'))
            EOF
            endif
